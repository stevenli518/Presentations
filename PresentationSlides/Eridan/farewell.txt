Hello everyone!

I will be leaving today as my last day of the internship. I will miss working with you all and hope the team all the best! It was so lucky for me to working in here. I felt like I grew up here,
and learned lots of things that I would never learn from the school in this 3 months. 


If we're not already connected on LinkedIn yet, please add me and so we can connect and keep in touch,

And Thanks again for this opportunity and everyone in Eridan! You guys are great!
